This is a very basic blog-type website using python-django. Anyone can create
an account and post anything. The front-end is only html.

The search feature lets you search posts that match the search words you enter.
It shows search results according to the number of words that matches to the
posts decrementally.

Without logging in you can see the feed and search. By logging in you can also
post.

The main feature is that the homepage always shows random posts from the data-
base. Every time you refresh it will show posts randomly from the database.

That's pretty much it.
